# 🚀 Get Started with Vertex AI Studio for Prompt Design


```markdown


This helps you explore **Vertex AI Studio** (Google Cloud's web interface for generative AI) and learn how to design powerful prompts using tools like **PaLM 2**, **Gemini**, and **Codey**.

## 🔗 Step 1: Open Vertex AI Studio

👉 Visit [Vertex AI Studio (MakerSuite)](https://makersuite.google.com/app)  
*(Best for beginners and fast prototyping)*

Or use the GCP console link if you're working in a cloud project:  
👉 [https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/prompt-studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/prompt-studio)

## 🧠 Step 2: Choose Your Use Case

In Vertex AI Studio, you can experiment with:

- 📝 **Text Prompting** – Content generation, summarization, classification
- 💬 **Chat Interface** – Build intelligent assistants
- 💻 **Code Generation** – Python, SQL, JavaScript using Codey
- 🖼️ **Multimodal Tasks** – Combine image + text (if supported in your region)

---

## ✍️ Step 3: Create a New Prompt

Click on **“+ New Prompt”** to get started. Try prompts like:

```plaintext
Write a professional resume summary for a fresher data analyst based in Mumbai looking for their first job.
```

You can adjust:
- 🔥 **Temperature** – Controls creativity
- ✏️ **Max Output Tokens** – Controls output length
- 🎯 **Top-K & Top-P** – Controls randomness
- 💡 **Few-shot Examples** – Give input-output pairs to guide the model

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Test and Refine

Try variations of your prompt like:

```plaintext
Generate 3 bullet points about a data analyst fresher skilled in Excel, Python, and Power BI, based in Mumbai.
```

Tips for better results:
- Provide **context** (e.g., experience, location, skills)
- Use **clear instructions**
- Include **desired output format** (bullet points, JSON, etc.)

## 🔄 Optional: Use Python with Vertex AI SDK

Once you're ready to move beyond the UI:

### ✅ Install SDK

```bash
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
```

### ✅ Sample Code

```python
from vertexai.preview.language_models import TextGenerationModel
import vertexai

# Initialize Vertex AI
vertexai.init(project="your-gcp-project-id", location="us-central1")

# Load the model
model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained("text-bison@001")

# Run your prompt
prompt = "Write a professional summary for a data analyst fresher in Mumbai."

response = model.predict(
    prompt,
    temperature=0.7,
    max_output_tokens=256,
    top_k=40,
    top_p=0.8,
)

print(response.text)
```

## 💡 Prompt Engineering Best Practices

- ✅ Provide context and role
- ✅ Use few-shot examples when needed
- ✅ Specify format (list, paragraph, table, etc.)
- ✅ Iterate based on output
